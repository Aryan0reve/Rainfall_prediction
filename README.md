Overview:
This project implements a rainfall prediction system using Machine Learning 
techniques in Python. The model is trained on historical weather data to 
predict future rainfall patterns based on various meteorological parameters.


Features:
1.Data preprocessing and feature selection
2.Machine Learning model training and evaluation
3.Performance comparison of Logistic Regression and XGBoost
4.Visualization of results


Technologies Used:
1.Python
2.Pandas
3.NumPy
4.Matplotlib
5.Seaborn
6.Scikit-learn
7.XGBoost


Model Performance:
The project compares two ML models:
1.Logistic Regression
2.XGBoost


Model accuracy and performance metrics (e.g., Precision, Recall, 
F1-score) are analyzed.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of historical weather data with parameters
like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
